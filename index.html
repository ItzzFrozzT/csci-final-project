      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! Iâ€™m Axel Lopez, and this website is my final project for my computer science class. I wanted to create something that tells my story, shows what Iâ€™ve learned, and reflects why Iâ€™m passionate about technology. 
        Computers have always been a part of my life, from playing games as a kid to building websites like this one. Now that Iâ€™m studying Computer Science in college, Iâ€™ve come to appreciate just how powerful and important these machines are.

      <h2>What Youâ€™ll Find Here</h2>
      <p>
        This site is like a mini presentation. I talk about the history of computers and how far we've come, where technology is going, and the amazing people who made it all possible. 
        I even included some fun facts, a simple explanation of how computers work, and my personal reasons for choosing this field. If you click the tabs above, each one will take you to a page where I go into more detail.

      <h2>Thanks for Visiting</h2>
      <p>
        Whether you're a student, a teacher, or just someone checking out my project, thanks for stopping by. I hope this gives you a clear picture of how much I enjoy working with technologyâ€”and maybe youâ€™ll even learn something new too!
