      <h2>Hey, Iâ€™m Axel ðŸ‘‹</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my space online! I made this site to show what I love about computers â€” not just the technical stuff, but the fun, the creativity, and how they make life better. 
        Whether itâ€™s gaming, building PCs, or just learning how everything works, tech has always been something Iâ€™m excited about.

      <h2>What Youâ€™ll Find Here</h2>
      <p>
        This site walks through everything from the history of computers to where theyâ€™re heading in the future. 
        I highlight the people who made big breakthroughs, share some fun and random facts, and break down how computers actually work (in a simple way). 
        I also explain why I personally enjoy all of this â€” and what got me into it in the first place.

      <h2>Why I Made This</h2>
      <p>
        For me, this wasnâ€™t just about finishing a project â€” it was about putting together something real. 
        Everything on here reflects my experience, what Iâ€™ve learned, and what Iâ€™m into. 
        If youâ€™re curious, go ahead and explore the links above. 
        Whether you know a lot about computers or just want to learn something new, I hope you find something cool here.
