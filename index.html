  <h1>Welcome to My Computer Science Project!</h1>

  <p>Hey! I’m Axel Lopez. I’ve always thought computers are super cool, like magic machines that can do anything!  
  I picked Computer Science because I want to learn how to build awesome stuff like games, robots, and apps.  
  Ever since I was a kid, I loved messing around with computers, and now I’m excited to learn how they really work and create cool things myself!</p>

  <p>This is a pic from when I first got my hands on a computer. I felt like a superhero pressing all the buttons and exploring new worlds!</p>
