      <h2>Hey, Iâ€™m Axel ðŸ‘‹</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™ve always had a thing for computers. Not just using them, but understanding how they tick â€” whatâ€™s inside, what they can do, and how theyâ€™ve changed the world around us. 
        This site is my space to share everything I love about tech, from its roots to where itâ€™s headed.

      <h2>Whatâ€™s Inside?</h2>
      <p>
        Youâ€™ll find pages about the history of computers, where technology is going next, cool facts, and even some behind-the-scenes stuff about how computers actually work. 
        I also talk about some of the brilliant minds behind it all â€” the legends who paved the way for the tech we use every day.

      <h2>Just Getting Started</h2>
      <p>
        Technology moves fast, but my curiosity moves faster. I made this site as a way to share what Iâ€™ve learned so far â€” and itâ€™s just the beginning. 
        If youâ€™re into computers too, or just curious, check out the pages up top and explore with me.
