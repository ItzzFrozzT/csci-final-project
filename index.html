  <h1>Welcome to My Computer Science Project!</h1>

  <p>Hello there! My name is Axel Lopez. I love computers because they are like big magic boxes that can do so many amazing things!  
  I chose to study Computer Science because I want to learn how to build cool stuff, like games, robots, and smart apps.  
  When I was little, I loved playing with computers and games, so now I want to learn even more and make my own awesome things!</p>

  <p>Here is a picture of when I first played with a computer. It was so much fun! I felt like a superhero who could do anything!</p>
