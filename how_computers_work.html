      <h2>The Basics</h2>
      <p>
        At the heart of every computer is something called a CPU — kind of like the brain. It follows instructions step by step, doing math, making decisions, and running programs. 
        Everything you see on the screen — videos, games, websites — is the result of millions of tiny actions happening in the background, really fast.

      <h2>Input and Output</h2>
      <p>
        When you type on a keyboard, move a mouse, or touch a screen, you’re giving the computer input. It takes that input, processes it, and then gives you output — like showing a letter, opening a file, or playing a sound.
        It’s basically a nonstop conversation between you and the machine.

      <h2>It’s All Ones and Zeros</h2>
      <p>
        Everything a computer does is based on binary code — just 1s and 0s. Even images and music are broken down into these numbers. 
        The computer uses electricity to turn tiny switches on and off, and that’s how it stores and processes all the data.

      <h2>Inside the Machine</h2>
      <p>
        A computer might look simple on the outside, but inside it’s packed with parts that all work together. Here’s a quick breakdown:
      </p>

      <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
        <li><strong>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</strong> This is the brain. It does all the thinking and calculations, and it handles instructions from programs and the operating system.</li><br>

        <li><strong>RAM (Random Access Memory):</strong> Think of this as your computer’s short-term memory. It temporarily holds data for active programs so they run smoothly. The more RAM you have, the more tasks your computer can handle at once.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Storage (HDD or SSD):</strong> This is the long-term memory. It stores everything — files, photos, games, and even the system itself. SSDs (Solid State Drives) are faster and more modern than old-school hard drives (HDDs).</li><br>

        <li><strong>GPU (Graphics Processing Unit):</strong> If the CPU is the brain, the GPU is the artist. It handles all the visuals — from basic images to complex 3D graphics in games and video editing.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Motherboard:</strong> This is the main circuit board that connects everything together. All your parts plug into the motherboard so they can communicate and work as one system.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Power Supply:</strong> Just like it sounds — it gives power to the whole machine. Without this, nothing turns on.</li><br>

        <li><strong>Cooling System (fans or liquid coolers):</strong> Computers get hot when they’re working hard. Cooling systems keep temperatures down so the parts don’t overheat.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Every part has a job. When they work together, you get a fast, reliable machine that can do everything from writing documents to streaming movies or playing games.
