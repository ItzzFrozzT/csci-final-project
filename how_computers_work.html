      <h2>The Basics</h2>
      <p>
        At the heart of every computer is something called a CPU — kind of like the brain. It follows instructions step by step, doing math, making decisions, and running programs. 
        Everything you see on the screen — videos, games, websites — is the result of millions of tiny actions happening in the background, really fast.

      <h2>Input and Output</h2>
      <p>
        When you type on a keyboard, move a mouse, or touch a screen, you’re giving the computer input. It takes that input, processes it, and then gives you output — like showing a letter, opening a file, or playing a sound.
        It’s basically a nonstop conversation between you and the machine.

      <h2>It’s All Ones and Zeros</h2>
      <p>
        Everything a computer does is based on binary code — just 1s and 0s. Even images and music are broken down into these numbers. 
        The computer uses electricity to turn tiny switches on and off, and that’s how it stores and processes all the data.

      <h2>Inside the Machine</h2>
      <p>
        Besides the CPU, computers have memory (RAM), storage (hard drives or SSDs), and graphics processors (GPUs). Each part plays a role:
        memory holds stuff temporarily, storage saves things permanently, and GPUs help with visuals like games or videos.
