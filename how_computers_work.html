  <h1>How Computers Work</h1>

  <p>Inside a computer, everything is about talking with little electric signals!  
  When you press a key or click your mouse, tiny switches inside the computer turn on and off really fast — way faster than blinking your eyes!  
  All that magic helps the computer show you videos, games, and websites.</p>

  <h2>Magic Machines</h2>
  <p>It’s like a huge team of tiny workers inside your computer, all working together at super speed.  
  That’s how even the craziest games and coolest apps are possible!</p>
