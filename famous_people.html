      <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
      <p>
        Ada Lovelace is often called the world’s first computer programmer. Back in the 1800s — way before electronic computers — she wrote an algorithm for a machine that didn’t even fully exist yet. 
        She had this amazing ability to see how numbers could be used for more than just math — like creating music or art. Her vision was way ahead of her time.

      <h2>Alan Turing</h2>
      <p>
        Alan Turing is one of the most important figures in computer science. During World War II, he helped crack secret enemy codes using early computer-like machines. 
        That work saved millions of lives and also laid the groundwork for what we now call artificial intelligence. Without Turing, modern computing might not even exist.

      <h2>Grace Hopper</h2>
      <p>
        Grace Hopper was a computer scientist and Navy Rear Admiral who helped invent one of the first programming languages. She believed that computers should be able to understand human-like commands, not just ones and zeros.
        Thanks to her work, programming became much easier and more accessible to everyone.

      <h2>More Modern Names</h2>
      <p>
        There are tons of other people who’ve made big impacts — like Bill Gates (Microsoft), Steve Jobs (Apple), and Tim Berners-Lee (the web). 
        Each of them helped shape how we use technology today — from the software we run to the devices we carry in our pockets.
