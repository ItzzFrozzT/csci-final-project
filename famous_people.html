      <h2>Ada Lovelace</h2>
      <p>
        Ada Lovelace is widely considered the first computer programmer in history — and this was back in the 1800s. She worked alongside Charles Babbage, who had designed a machine called the Analytical Engine (an early concept of a computer). 
        Ada saw that this machine could do much more than just math — it could follow complex instructions, like a program. She wrote what many believe to be the first algorithm, which makes her the original coder long before computers as we know them even existed.
        What's even cooler is that she imagined computers creating music or graphics long before anyone else did. Her vision was way ahead of its time.

      <h2>Alan Turing</h2>
      <p>
        Alan Turing was a British mathematician, logician, and cryptanalyst who laid the foundation for modern computing and artificial intelligence. 
        During World War II, he helped break the German Enigma code, which saved millions of lives and helped end the war sooner. He designed the “Turing Machine,” a theoretical model of a computer that could read and process instructions — basically, an early idea of how computers would work.
        Turing also asked deep questions like, "Can machines think?" — sparking the beginning of AI. Even today, his work is used as the basis for testing a machine's intelligence — known as the Turing Test.

      <h2>Grace Hopper</h2>
      <p>
        Rear Admiral Grace Hopper was a pioneer in both the Navy and computer science. She helped develop the first compiler — a tool that translates human-readable code into something a computer can understand.
        She was instrumental in creating COBOL, one of the earliest high-level programming languages, which is still used in some banks and government systems today.
        Hopper was known for making complex ideas easier to understand and believed that programming should be accessible to more people. Her legacy also includes the popular term “debugging,” which came from removing a literal bug (a moth) from a machine.

      <h2>More Modern Legends</h2>
      <p>
        In more recent decades, figures like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Tim Berners-Lee have left major marks on the tech world.
        Gates co-founded Microsoft and helped bring affordable computers and software into homes and schools. Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple, pushed innovation with sleek design and user-friendly tech, revolutionizing phones, music, and personal computing. 
        And then there's Tim Berners-Lee — he invented the World Wide Web in the 1990s, allowing us to browse, link, and build websites like this one. Without him, the internet wouldn’t be what it is today.
