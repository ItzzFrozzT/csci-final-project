  <h1>Famous People in Computer Science</h1>

  <p>Computer science has some real rockstars!  
  People like Ada Lovelace, who was the first computer programmer ever, and Alan Turing, who helped crack secret codes during World War II.  
  Then there’s Grace Hopper — she invented one of the first programming languages! These legends helped build the tech world we have today.</p>

  <h2>Big Thanks to the Pioneers</h2>
  <p>Without these smart and creative people, we might still be stuck using giant slow machines.  
  They dreamed big and made computers what they are today!</p>
