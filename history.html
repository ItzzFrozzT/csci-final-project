  <h1>History of Computers</h1>

  <p>A long, long time ago, computers were really, really big!  
  They were as big as a whole room! People made them to help with math and solve hard problems.  
  The first computers were very slow and could not play games or show pictures. They only knew how to work with numbers!</p>

  <h2>Old Computers</h2>
  <p>This is what some of the very first computers looked like.  
  They had lots of buttons, switches, and big blinking lights. Only trained people could use them!</p>
