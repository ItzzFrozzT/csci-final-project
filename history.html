  <h1>History of Computers</h1>

  <p>A long, long time ago, computers were really, really big!  
  They were as big as a whole room! People made them to help with math and hard problems because they didn’t want to do all the thinking by themselves.  
  The first computers were super slow and couldn’t play games or show pictures. They could only think about numbers and solve puzzles!</p>

  <h2>Old Computers</h2>
  <p>This is what some of the first computers looked like.  
  They had lots of buttons, switches, and big blinking lights. People needed special training to use them!</p>
