      <h2>Where It All Began</h2>
      <p>
        Computers didn’t start out looking anything like the laptops and phones we have today. In fact, the first computers were giant machines that filled entire rooms.
        They didn’t have screens or keyboards — just rows of switches, wires, and blinking lights. These early machines were mostly used by scientists and the military to do complicated calculations that would take humans hours or even days to finish.

      <h2>The 1940s to 1960s: The Room-Size Era</h2>
      <p>
        One of the first electronic computers was called the ENIAC. It was built in the 1940s and could perform thousands of calculations per second — which was a huge deal at the time. But it also used up a ton of electricity and took up a space as big as a classroom.
        These early machines had no software — you had to physically rewire them to change what they did!

      <h2>The Rise of Personal Computers</h2>
      <p>
        Fast-forward to the 1970s and 80s — that’s when the idea of “personal computers” really took off. Companies like Apple, IBM, and Microsoft helped bring computers into homes and schools.
        For the first time, regular people could use computers to type papers, play games, or learn new things — and that completely changed the world.

      <h2>Today’s Tech</h2>
      <p>
        Now, we carry computers in our pockets. Phones, watches, cars, and even refrigerators can be considered computers.
        They're fast, small, and smart — and they keep getting better every year. Looking back at where they started really shows how far we've come.
