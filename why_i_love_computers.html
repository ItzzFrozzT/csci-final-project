      <h2>More Than Just a Machine</h2>
      <p>
        For me, computers are more than just tech — they’re a way to create, explore, and figure things out. I’ve always been curious about how things work, and computers are like puzzles you can actually solve.
        They give you the power to build something from nothing, whether it’s a website, a game, or even just an idea brought to life with code.

      <h2>Endless Possibilities</h2>
      <p>
        What I love most is how computers are everywhere — in phones, cars, cameras, watches, and even in places you wouldn’t expect, like farms or hospitals.
        Learning about computers means I can be part of all kinds of things: solving problems, creating tools, and maybe even building the next big idea.

      <h2>Why I Keep Going</h2>
      <p>
        There’s always something new to learn in tech. That’s what keeps me going — there’s no limit to how far you can go or what you can create.
        I don’t just want to use technology. I want to understand it. I want to shape it. And that’s why I love computers.
