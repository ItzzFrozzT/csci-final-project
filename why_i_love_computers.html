  <h1>Why I Love Computers</h1>

  <p>Computers are awesome because they let you do anything you can dream up!  
  Want to build a robot? Make a video game? Talk to someone on the other side of the world?  
  You can do all that and more with computers. It's like having a superpower!</p>

  <h2>Dream Big!</h2>
  <p>I love computers because they open up a world full of possibilities.  
  Every day there’s something new to learn, and that's what makes it so exciting!</p>
