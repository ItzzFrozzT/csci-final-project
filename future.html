  <h1>The Future of Computers</h1>

  <p>Today’s computers are getting faster, smaller, and way smarter!  
  In the future, computers might drive cars, help doctors save lives, and even fly rockets to Mars!  
  We could even have robots living with us and smart computers that can actually talk and think like people. Sounds awesome, right?</p>

  <h2>Super Speed Computers</h2>
  <p>Right now, there are computers that are so crazy fast, they can figure out really hard stuff in just a second!  
  They help scientists with space missions, fixing sickness, and even saving the environment.  
  They’re like real-life superheroes but made of wires and code!</p>
