      <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
      <p>
        Computers have already come a long way — but the future is even more exciting. Right now, we're entering an era where computers can not only process information fast, but they can actually learn, make decisions, and help solve complex problems in ways we’ve never seen before.
        It’s no longer about just typing or clicking — it’s about what computers can do on their own.

      <h2>AI and Machine Learning</h2>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence is already changing the way we live. From chatbots and voice assistants to self-driving cars, AI is teaching computers how to think and improve over time.
        As the tech gets better, computers will be able to write music, diagnose diseases, and even help with climate change research.

      <h2>Quantum Computing</h2>
      <p>
        Traditional computers use bits — 1s and 0s. But quantum computers use qubits, which can be both 1 and 0 at the same time. That makes them insanely powerful for solving huge problems, like simulating molecules or cracking advanced codes.
        We’re still in the early days, but quantum computing could change everything.

      <h2>Faster, Smaller, Smarter</h2>
      <p>
        Every year, our devices get faster and more efficient. Phones are basically tiny supercomputers, and new chips make laptops powerful enough for things like video editing, 3D design, and gaming.
        Eventually, we might see tech built into glasses, clothes, or even inside the body.

      <h2>What It All Means</h2>
      <p>
        The future of computers is about possibility. Faster thinking, smarter systems, and technology that blends into everyday life. It’s exciting — and a little wild — to think about what’s coming next.
